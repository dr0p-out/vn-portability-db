VN portability database
=======================

This is a list of [visual novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_novel) with information about how portable they are

## What is this?

Portability here is about allowing to launch VNs on more operating systems and processor architectures without a virtual machine or emulator

Another goal is to avoid use of any component which doesn't have its source code available

## All vendors

[夜のひつじ](brands/夜のひつじ.md)

[Parasol](brands/Parasol.md)

sometimes, there is chances you can get some unlisted games to work if you can guess what [engine](engines) it uses; if you followed instructions in this repository and was able to launch a new game and test, we will appreciate it if you open a [Pull Request on GitHub](../../pulls) helping us to add documentations here about its name and engine information
